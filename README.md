# Character Creator Deployed with CDK (Typescript)
This is a CDK project that deploys the Character Creator application to AWS. It is a work in progress. 
The frontend is deployed to AWS S3 and the backend is deployed as a Lambda function behind an API Gateway.
Cloudfront is used to serve the frontend from S3 and to proxy requests to the API Gateway.

## Requirements
[Node](nodejs.org) version 12 or higher.
[AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) installed and configured with your credentials.
[CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html) installed globally. `npm install -g aws-cdk`

## Steps Getting Started
This requires you to have the AWS CLI installed and configured with your credentials.
You will need to Bootstrap the CDK in your AWS account. `cdk bootstrap` will do this for you.
Complete the steps to install dependencies, test and run the project locally.

## Local Steps
### Installation
From the root project directory, `npm install:all`. Alternatively, `cd` into into each directory with a `package.json` and `npm install`.
### Test
From the root directory, `npm test` to run all defined unit tests for the API and the UI (frontend). To test each in isolation, `cd` into the relevant directory and `npm test`.
### Run
From the root directory, `npm start` to run both the API and the UI locally. By default, the API is configured to run at `http://localhost:8000`, the UI is configured to run at `http://localhost:3000` and the UI is configured to proxy API requests to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Cloud Deploy Steps
After you have installed dependencies, tested and run the project locally, you can deploy it to AWS.
From the root directory, `npm run build` to build the project. Then, `cdk deploy` to deploy the project to AWS.
From the root directory, `cdk deploy` or `ck deploy --profile <your-profile>` to deploy the API and the UI to AWS. The UI will be served from S3 via Cloudfront.
